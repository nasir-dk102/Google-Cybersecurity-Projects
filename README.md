## 📁 Project 6: Algorithm for file updates in Python


### 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based file update algorithm used to manage access control by processing IP address lists. It simulates how a 🔐 Security Analyst 🔐 might automate updates to access control files to improve efficiency and reduce human error in operational environments.
### 🔍 Scenario Summary

📌 Task: Remove unauthorized IPs from the allow list
📌 Cause: Some IPs on the allow list no longer meet access requirements
📌 Impact: Manual updates are time-consuming and error-prone
📌 Solution: A Python script that automatically compares and removes IPs listed in a separate "remove list"
📌 Outcome: Faster, reliable, and repeatable access control management

### 🛠️ Key steps in the algorithm 

✔️ Read: Load the allow_list.txt file into memory
✔️ Split: Convert the file content into a Python list of IP addresses
✔️ Compare: Iterate through a remove_list and check for matches
✔️ Filter: Remove any IPs from the allow list that are found in the remove list
✔️ Write: Save the updated list back to the file

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

🔹 Automation saves time – Updating files programmatically avoids manual errors
🔹 Python is powerful – Simple functions like read(), split(), remove(), and join() streamline the process
🔹 Secure operations – Reliable access control management is essential for maintaining secure environments
🔹 File handling best practices – Using with open() ensures safe and efficient file management
