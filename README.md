## 📁 Project 1: Multimedia Company - Incident Report Analysis

### 📌 Overview

 A **🔴 DDoS Attack 🔴** targeted a multimedia company's internal network, disrupting services for **⏳ Two Hours ⏳**. This report follows the **📜 NIST Cybersecurity Framework 📜** to investigate the incident, mitigate vulnerabilities, and prevent future attacks.

### 🔍 Scenario Summary

📌 **Attack Type:** ICMP Flood (DDoS)  
📌 **Cause:** Firewall misconfiguration allowed excessive ICMP packets  
📌 **Impact:** Internal network services were inaccessible  
📌 **Response:** Incident response team blocked ICMP packets & restored services  
📌 **Analysis Method:** Applied **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**  

### 🛠️ NIST Framework Breakdown

✔️ **Identify:** Located the **🚧 Firewall Misconfiguration 🚧** as the root cause.  
✔️ **Protect:** Implemented **firewall rules, source IP verification, and IDS/IPS**.  
✔️ **Detect:** Deployed **network monitoring tools** to identify abnormal traffic.  
✔️ **Respond:** Blocked attack traffic and restored critical network functions.  
✔️ **Recover:** Strengthened **DDoS mitigation strategies & security policies**.

## 📁 Project 2: Decrypt an Encrypted Message

### 📌 Overview
In my home directory, I have a few files that have been encrypted with caesar cipher. The task is find and decrypt them using **'tr'** command and **OpenSSL**

### ⌨️ Linux commands, options and tools used
🖋 **tr command** <br>
🖋 **OpenSSL** <br>
🖋 **ls command along with -a option** <br>
🖋 **cat command** <br>
🖋 **cd command** <br>

### 🔍 Scenario Summary
📌 **Files discovered:** using 'pwd' and 'ls -a' command I navigated to the files <br>
📌 **Files opened:** cat command allowed me to open the files <br> 
📌 **Caesar cipher:** using 'tr' command, I shifted the letters back by 3 to uncover the message <br> 
📌 **Decrypting the file:** The Q1.encryped file was decrypted using OpenSSL <br>

## 📁 Project 3: Create hash values

### 📌 Overview
In this project I will investigate two files that appear to be identical, I will compare their hash values. If the hash values differ, it confirms that the files are not identical.**

### ⌨️ Linux commands, options and tools used
🖋 **sha256sum command** <br>
🖋 **cat** <br>
🖋 **ls command along with -a option** <br>
🖋 **>> operator** <br>
🖋 **cmp command** <br>

### 🔍 Scenario Summary
📌 **Generate hashes for files:** using 'pwd' and 'ls -a' command I navigated to the files <br>
📌 **Compare hashes:** cat command allowed me to open the files <br>
