## 📁 Project 1: Multimedia Company - Incident Report Analysis

### 📌 Overview

 A **🔴 DDoS Attack 🔴** targeted a multimedia company's internal network, disrupting services for **⏳ Two Hours ⏳**. This report follows the **📜 NIST Cybersecurity Framework 📜** to investigate the incident, mitigate vulnerabilities, and prevent future attacks.

### 🔍 Scenario Summary

📌 **Attack Type:** ICMP Flood (DDoS)  
📌 **Cause:** Firewall misconfiguration allowed excessive ICMP packets  
📌 **Impact:** Internal network services were inaccessible  
📌 **Response:** Incident response team blocked ICMP packets & restored services  
📌 **Analysis Method:** Applied **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**  

### 🛠️ NIST Framework Breakdown

✔️ **Identify:** Located the **🚧 Firewall Misconfiguration 🚧** as the root cause.  
✔️ **Protect:** Implemented **firewall rules, source IP verification, and IDS/IPS**.  
✔️ **Detect:** Deployed **network monitoring tools** to identify abnormal traffic.  
✔️ **Respond:** Blocked attack traffic and restored critical network functions.  
✔️ **Recover:** Strengthened **DDoS mitigation strategies & security policies**.
